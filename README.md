\# Monte Carlo U-235 Criticality Simulation



A Monte Carlo simulation of neutron-induced fission in U-235 to estimate

the effective multiplication factor k and explore subcritical, critical,

and supercritical regimes.



\## Methods

\- Random sampling of neutron paths and fission events

\- Statistical estimation of k with uncertainty (SEM)

\- Parameter sweeps over material density and geometry



\## Files

\- `monte-carlo-u235-criticality.ipynb`: full analysis and figures

\- `monte-carlo-u235-criticality.py`: executable simulation logic



\## Key Takeaway

Demonstrates how stochastic methods recover macroscopic nuclear behavior

and how statistical uncertainty scales with sample size.
